# Patient-admission-duration-prediction-Healthcare-Analytics

The project here is to analyze the dataset and accurately predict the Length of Stay for each patient on case by case basis so that the Hospitals can use this information for optimal resource allocation and better functioning. The length of stay is divided into 11 different classes ranging from 0-10 days to more than 100 days.

I used classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest and CatBoost to classify the lenght of stay.
